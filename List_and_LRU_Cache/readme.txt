ArrayBasedMyList.h
This file contains the main generic class "MyList" which is implemented by an array. This array uses dynamic memory allocation. This implementation has all necessary member functions and
a function which displays the current list. 

LinkedListBasedMyList.h
This file contains the main class "MyList" which is implemented by nodes and pointers. This list has three node objects which are head, currentPosition and tail. All the data is stored in 
pointers of nodes. This implementation has all necessary member functions and a function which displays the current list.

LRU_Cahe_implementation.cpp
This file contains a generic class which can implement a cache replacement algorithm called Least Recently Used. It can use both array-based MyList implementation and Linked list based
MyList implementation.
