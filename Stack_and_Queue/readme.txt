ArrayBasedMyQueue.h
This file contains the main generic class "MyQueue" which is implemented by an array.This queue class is circular. This array uses dynamic memory allocation. This implementation has all 
necessary member functions and a function which displays the current queue. 

LinkedListBasedMyQueue.h
This file contains the main class "MyQueue" which is implemented by nodes and pointers. This list has two node objects which are head and tail. All the data is stored in pointers of nodes. 
This implementation has all necessary member functions and a function which displays the current queue.

ArrayBasedMyStack.h
This file contains the main generic class "MyStack" which is implemented by an array. This array uses dynamic memory allocation. THis implementation has all necessary memeber functions and
a function which displays the current stack.

LinkedListBasedMyStack.h
This file contains the main class "MyStack" which is implemented by nodes and pointers. This list has two node objects which are head and tail. All the data is stored in pointers of nodes.
This implementation has all necessary member functions and a function which displays the current stack.

LinkedListBasedMyQueue&MyStack.h
This file is for task_2 implementation. To solve task_2 with MyQueue and MyStack (both linked list based implementation) this file must be included to avoid redefination error. 

Task_2 header file include guide
1. "ArrayBasedMyQueue.h" and "ArrayBasedMyStack.h"
2. "ArrayBasedMyQueue.h" and "LinkedListBasedMyStack.h"
3. "LinkedListBasedMyQueue.h" and "ArrayBasedMyStack.h"
4. "LinkedListBasedMyQueue&MyStack.h"
Use any one of the header file include combination.
